;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides Magit-style ad-hoc command runners for Majutsu.
;; Plain `jj ...' commands are routed through Majutsu's process helpers so
;; they inherit `--no-pager', color handling, process buffering, and
;; with-editor integration.  Other commands are run through the shell.
